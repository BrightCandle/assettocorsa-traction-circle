assettocorsa-traction-circle
============================

Plots the acceleration values (G) of the car so the driver can see how well the interaction with traction during cornering and breaking.

Keeps the last X seconds worth of observed values and automatically fades them by age (brighter values are more recent) leaving a trail.


Roadmap
=======

In the future I would like to:

* Highlight when the slip angle/wheel spin or lockup is happening to flag when the driver has used up too much traction
* Plot a moving average as a line-plot to show course-grained view than the scatter-plot
